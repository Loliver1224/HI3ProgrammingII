Vietnamese Cities Consider Motorbike Ban

Vietnamese is the biggest maket for motobiles in the world. Peoplle everything from
pigs to dining tables on their motobiles, and it's common to see a family of five riding
together on the two-wheeled vehicles.

Despite this, city officials in Hanoi and ChiMinh City have suggested banning
motobiles from the busiest parts of the cities during the busiest times of the day.

A complete ban on motobiles is very unlikely, but the idea has led to a debate about
pollution, traffic problems, city planning, and the fastest way to get people where they
need to go.

Nguyen Ngoc Dong, who leads Vietnam's Ministry of Transport says there are a lot of
issuesthat need to be worked out before making a final plan.

Supporters of a motobile ban argue that it is needef to reduce pollution and traffic. but
critics say a Motorbike ban would hurt the poor.

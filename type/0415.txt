Electric Vehicles Outsell Petrol, Diesel Cars in Norway

Electric cars outsold petrol and diesel-powered ones in Norway last month for the first
time ever.

Christina Bu, the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association's general secretary, said that
58.4 percent of new cars sold in the country in March were battery-powered.

"Norway shows the whole world that the electric car can replace cars powered by
gasoline and diesel, " Bu said in a statement, adding that electric cars play an important
role in the flight against climate change.
